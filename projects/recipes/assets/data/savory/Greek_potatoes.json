Take them off the stove and leave them sitting in the pan with the liquid until you are ready to throw them in a hot oven. Cook until they are crisp and golden."

On the rare occasion that any are left over, they’re delicious eaten cold or tossed through a green salad like croutons. The original Moosewood cookbook recipe suggested including 1½ teaspoons dried oregano, but I never do, although this would make it more traditionally Greek. They’re also good with crumbled feta and chopped parsley added at the end. You can reduce the volume of oil if you are careful not to let it stick towards the end of cooking time.",
